            <p>
              Chadwick Boseman had early success as a stage actor, writer and
              director, before landing gigs on TV shows like Lincoln Heights.
              Boseman broke through with his big screen portrayals of two
              African American icons: baseball player Jackie Robinson in 42, and
              soul singer James Brown in Get on Up. Boseman later took on the
              role of Black Panther for a series of Marvel superhero films,
              including the immensely successful Black Panther in early 2018.

            <h4>Avengers: Endgame</h4>

            <p>
              Thanos, the Mad Titan, has set into motion events that are
              destroying the universe. The superheroes' ranks are fractured
              after 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2017). The remaining Avengers
              reassemble to undo the chaos left in Thanos' wake. As they call in
              allies and travel back and forth in time, they attempt to reverse
              the consequences of Thanos' devastation and restore order to the
              universe.

            <p>
              Thanos, the evil Mad Titan, is on a mission to collect all six
              Infinity Stones. His plan, once he acquires the stones, is to
              destroy half of all life in the universe. In this 'Avengers:
              Endgame' prequel, the Avengers and their superhero allies risk all
              in the ultimate fight for the fate of existence itself.

              Prince T'Challa returns home to become king of Wakanda, a
              high-tech African utopia. He is challenged by an old nemesis, Erik
              Killmonger, who seeks revenge and power. The two battle for the
